In this lesson we have learned:
  - GitHub workflow
  - Commits and a good practice to right a good commit message:
    - Donâ€™t end your commit message with a period.
    - Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in
    the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the
    subject line.
    - Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "merge"
      instead of "merged".
    - Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.
